### Prerequisites 
You will need to install Python and Jupiter Notebooks to work with the data.

Download [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) for a hassle-free way of configuring your development environment. 

> You probably want to download the Python 3 version b/c Python 2 will become unsupported [soon](https://pythonclock.org/)


### Getting Started

Once `jupiter` is installed, you can start the notebook server and open the "Getting Started" notebook

```
jupyter notebook notebooks/Getting_Started.ipynb
```
